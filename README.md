# About DSMovie

https://dsmovie-filipe.netlify.app/ 

DSMovie is a full stack web application that allows users to score a group of Movies/Tv Shows. The users need to inform their e-mail and choose a number (from 1 to 5)
which represents their score. The score will be saved and it will be incremented into other scores creating an avarage score thereafter. The application will show the number of evaluation 
as well.
I developed this application during Spring React Week Bootcamp by DevSuperior (https://www.linkedin.com/school/devsuperior/). The event was headed by Professor Nelio Alves (https://www.linkedin.com/in/nelio-alves/).
